                What does the last letter mean?<br>
                (Hint: listen to the example sentences)"
                answer: "All of the words stated end with ь. This letter doesn’t represent a sound, it indicates softness (palatalization) of a previous consonant."

                (Hint: listen to the example sentences)"
                answer: "In all the adjectives from the list ё is stressed. It’s always stressed (for example, in nouns ребёнок, тётя, учёный as well)."

                        Find all the words that begin with a-<br>

                        What do these words have in common?
                answer: "All of the words that begin with a- in the SMARTool dictionary are borrowed words in Russian.<br>

                        Native Russian words do not begin with a-. the only exceptions are: ахать, ахнуть ‘say ah!’<br>

                        In general, most Russian words begin with a consonant. This includes words that begin with е-, ю-, я-, which begin with the consonant j- (sounds like y- in English). If a Russian word begins with a vowel, it is one of these: и-, о-, or у-."
                take_away_idea: If you encounter a long new word that begins with a vowel, it is probably a borrowed word. If you sound it out, you will probably recognize it. For example, аэропорт means ‘airport’, and you don’t need a dictionary to figure that out.

                        What do these words have in common?
                extra_task: If the meaning of the word in Russian differs from a similar sounding word in English, try to guess why.        
                answer: "All of the words that begin with ф- in the SMARTool dictionary are borrowed words in Russian.<br>
                Native Russian words do not begin with ф-. Only exceptions are фыркать (snort), фукать (from an interjection фу which shows disgust, ‘ew’)<br>
                фабрика - fabric: same etymology (Latin faber - “a workshop, art, trade, product of art, structure, fabric”)<br>
                фамилия - family name"
                take_away_idea: If you encounter a long new word that begins with ф-, it is probably a borrowed word. If you sound it out, you will probably recognize it. For example, факультет means ‘faculty’, and you don’t need a dictionary to figure that out.

                Find the words август, английский, англичанин, апрель, воскресенье, вторник, московский, российский. Compare them with their translations in English. All these words (and some others) have a common difference from the translations. What is the difference?"
                extra_task: "One of the examples for both московский and российский is capitalized, as opposed to other two. Why?" 
                answer: "All of the words aren’t capitalized in Russian, but are capitalized in English. Names of months and days of the week, as well as nouns and adjectives that describe ethnic identity all start with lowercase letters. Even though toponyms are capitalized (Россия, Москва), adjectives derived from them aren’t (российский, московский). <br> 
                Exceptions are cases like Московская область, Российская Федерация, where the adjective itself is a proper name."
                take_away_idea: "In Russian, less words are capitalized than in English. The two main cases when you should capitalize a word are proper names (Алексей, Париж) and the first word in a sentence (Мы идём домой)."

                answer: "In perfective verbs (for example, выйти, вынести) with вы- the prefix is always stressed.<br>
                In imperfective verbs with вы- the stress is usually after the root/in the latter part of the word."
                take_away_idea: "If you come across a perfective verb with the prefix вы-, you should read it with the stress on said prefix."

                        What kinds of items can be российский and what kind can be русский? Can you compare this with the use of the word иностранный?"
                answer: "We use российский to describe items connected to Russia as a state (паспорт, Федерация).<br>

                        We use русский to describe items connected to the Russian language, culture, and ethnic identity (алфавит, литература, авангард).<br>

                        For many items, you can use both adjectives, depending on what you want to emphasize.

                        For example: российские журналисты are journalists from Russia, where as русские журналисты are journalists who are Russian.<br>

                        The word иностранный can be used to describe both geopolitical relationships and those of language and culture."
                take_away_idea: русский is about ethnic identity, российский is about a relationship to the Russian Federation

                answer: "These are short form adjectives.<br>

                        Notice that рад ‘glad’ occurs only in short forms, has no long forms."
                take_away_idea: We use short form adjectives in sentences with the verb быть ‘be’ (and synonyms), which is also often omitted in the present tense, as in Мы всегда рады вас видеть. ‘We’re always happy to see you.’

                        Look up these words: кухня, ресторан<br>

                        Read the sentences. There are two patterns there that have to do with going to a place, being in a place, and going away from a place. Can you identify the two patterns?<br>

                        Once you have found the two patterns, look up and try to sort these words into two groups according to the two patterns:<br>

                        страна, мир, место, дом, школа, город, квартира, класс, свет, центр, улица, комната, район, театр, парк, музей, стадион, гостиница, остановка, вокзал, факультет, бассейн, общежитие, Россия, аэропорт, фабрика, столовая, аптека, номер, завод, университет, клуб, концерт, сад, площадь, здание, столица, кабинет, лекция, этаж"
                answer: "The two patterns are:<br>

                        на кухню (Accusative), на кухне (Locative), с кухни (Genitive)<br>

                        в ресторан (Accusative), в ресторане (Locative), из ресторана (Genitive)<br>

                        The pattern with в and из is used more than the one with на and с"
                take_away_idea: The preposition на is mostly used with large, open places (стадион, фабрика, завод, остановка, свет, место, вокзал), surfaces (площадь, этаж), or events (концерт, лекция). With other places we use the preposition в.

                answer: "Only singular in the SMARTool: вода, масло (NB! both ‘butter’ and ‘oil’), сок, сыр, мороженое, сахар, картошка (pluralis også mulig), колбаса (pluralis også mulig), чай, пиво, хлеб, мясо, молоко, вино, еда<br>

                        [Note: картошка and колбаса can also appear in plural, though less often.]<br>

                        Both singular and plural in the SMARTool: продукт (usually plural if referring to food), салат (plural refers to various kinds or portions of salad), яйцо, суп (plural refers to various kinds of soup), соль (if plural usually not about food, but about chemicals), курица (plural куры is used for animals, not food), рыба (plural рыбы is used for animals, not food), яблоко<br>

                        Only plural in the SMARTool: фрукт, овощ"
                take_away_idea: Many foods are primarily understood as substances in Russian, even if they come in fairly large pieces (potatoes, sausages, fish, chicken). These words tend to occur mostly or exclusively in the singular. Note that фрукты, овощи, продукты (when it means ‘groceries’) almost always occur in the plural, probably because they are not homogeneous (there are lots of kinds of fruits and vegetables and groceries). Food items that one tends to count (apples, eggs), are used in both singular and plural.

                This will show you words that occur often in the dative case, singular. Sort all the sentences into two groups. Put the sentences with prepositions before the dative case in one group, and sentences without a preposition that governs the dative in the other group.<br> 
                Which prepositions govern the dative case? What is the difference between them? What kind of nouns do you find in the dative case without a preposition?"
                answer: The prepositions are по (used with topics or ways to do things) and к (used with directions, including metaphorical ones). The nouns that appear in the dative without a preposition refer to people.
                take_away_idea: When the dative case is used without a preposition, it mainly expresses how experiences impact human beings.
